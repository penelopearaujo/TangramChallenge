# Tangram Challenge - WWDC Scholarship Application [Accepted]

This playground was created for WWDC 2019 Scholarship Application.

## Project
The Playground is a simple game for teaching kids a litte bit about geometric shapes using the chinese puzzle Tangram. They can learn what is a square, triangle and parallelogram and also build a rocket using the seven Tangram pieces.
This game was build mainly using the Swift frameworks SpriteKit and UIKit (and that's my very first project with SpriteKit! 👩🏻‍💻).

## How to play
Download the project file and open the .playground file using Xcode. Then, press the play button on the last line of code.

#### Have fun playing with it! ☺️
