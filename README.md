# Tangram Challenge - WWDC Scolarship Application [Accepted]

This playground was created for WWDC 2019 Scolarship Application.

## Project
The Playground is a simple game for teaching kids a litte bit about geometric shapes using the chinese puzzle Tangram. They can learn what is a square, triangle and parallelogram and also build a rocket using the seven Tangram pieces.
This game was build mainly using the Swift frameworks SpriteKit and UIKit (and that's my very first project with SpriteKit! 👩🏻‍💻)

#### Have fun playing with it! ☺️
